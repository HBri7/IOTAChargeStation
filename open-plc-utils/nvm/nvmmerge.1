.SH DESCRIPTION
Combine multiple binary image files into a single Qualcomm Atheros binary image file, leaving the original files intact.

.PP
Qualcomm Atheros image files consist of a chain of image headers, each followed by an image block.
Image blocks can contain data, applets or programs.
Atheros software reads the header chain and decides which images to download and execute based on information in image headers.
Tampering with image headers or images may void some contractual obligations made by Atheros.

This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.
See the \fBAMP\fR man page for an overview and installation instructions.

.SH ARGUMENTS

.TP
.IR file
The name of  a Qualcomm Atheros image file.
By convention, these image files have a \fB.nvm\fR file extension but this program does not enforce that convention.
Invalid image files will be rejected causing the output to be incomplete.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example combines three files, \fBabc-00.nvm\fR, \fBabc-01.nvm\fR and \fBabc-06.nvm\fR into one file \fBabc.nvm\fR.
Option \fB-v\fR displays the input file names as they are merged.
Program output is in binary format and so output should be directed to a file or pipe and not the console.

.PP
   # nvmmerge -v abc-00.nvm abc-01.nvm abc-06.nvm > abc.nvm
   nvmmerge: abc-00.nvm
   nvmmerge: abc-01.nvm
   nvmmerge: abc-06.nvm

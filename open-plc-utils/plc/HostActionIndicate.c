 *   This test plugin requests come action from a local host using a
 *   VS_HOST_ACTION indication message; the message must be sent to a
 *   host, not a device; it can be used to verify that your host
 *   application correctly responds to device requests;
 *
 *   this function is provided so that you can emulate a device boot
 *   sequence by prompting a listening host to download firmware; it
 *   has no practical purpose other than development and test;

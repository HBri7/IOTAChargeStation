nvmmerge(1)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                 nvmmerge(1)

NAME
       nvmmerge - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Firmware Image File Splicer

SYNOPSIS
       nvmmerge [options] file [file] [...]  [&gt;stdout]

DESCRIPTION
       Combine multiple binary image files into a single Qualcomm Atheros binary image file, leaving the original files intact.

       Qualcomm Atheros image files consist of a chain of image headers, each followed by an image block.  Image blocks can con‐
       tain data, applets or programs.  Atheros software reads the header chain and decides which images to download and execute
       based on information in image headers.  Tampering with image headers or images may void some contractual obligations made
       by Atheros.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an  overview  and  installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Suppresses printing of routine messages.  This option has no efect.

       -v     Print input file names on stderr as they are merged.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version  of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The  name of  a Qualcomm Atheros image file.  By convention, these image files have a .nvm file extension but this
              program does not enforce that convention.  Invalid image files will be rejected causing the output  to  be  incom‐
              plete.

EXAMPLES
       The  following example combines three files, abc-00.nvm, abc-01.nvm and abc-06.nvm into one file abc.nvm.  Option -v dis‐
       plays the input file names as they are merged.  Program output is in binary format and so output should be directed to  a
       file or pipe and not the console.

          # nvmmerge -v abc-00.nvm abc-01.nvm abc-06.nvm &gt; abc.nvm
          nvmmerge: abc-00.nvm
          nvmmerge: abc-01.nvm
          nvmmerge: abc-06.nvm

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros image file structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public informa‐
       tion is not available.  Qualcomm Atheros reserves the right to change  file  structure  or  content  in  future  firmware
       releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.  This program is reserved for use by Qual‐
       comm Atheros Field Engineers.  Use of this program may void certain contractual obligations made by Qualcomm Atheros.

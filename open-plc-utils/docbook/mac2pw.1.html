mac2pw(1)                                    Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                   mac2pw(1)

NAME
       mac2pw - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet Device Password Generator

SYNOPSIS
       mac2pw [options] address [address] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Print  a  range  of  consecutive  Ethernet addresses and passwords on stdout such that each device has a unique password.
       Program output is suitable as input to the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Production Test System or may be used  in  custom
       production  systems.   A  starting  address and an address range are specified.  Computed passwords consist of upper case
       letters and digits with optional group separators.  Output consists of address/password pairs in text format.

       This program is designed to generate passwords for a large number of consecutive device addresses.  It  complements  pro‐
       gram mac2pwd which generates passwords for non-consecutive device addresses occurring in unspecified order.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

CAVEATS
       Atheros provides this program as a simple means of generating unique device passwords for  a  large  volume  of  Ethernet
       devices.  Two different password algorithms are implemented but neither one is required for HomePlug AV compliance.  Ven‐
       dors are free to use other methods to generate their own device passwords and are encouraged to do so.

       Random Method
              Generate passwords based on system entropy.  A different set of passwords is generated for a given  address  range
              with  each  program execution.  There is no correlation at between addresses and passwords.  This method is secure
              but requires care when programming and labelling devices at the factory.  It may be necessary to maintain a  data‐
              base if regular device maintenance and firmware upgrade are needed.

       Device Method
              Generate passwords based on device address.  The same set of passwords will be generated for a given address range
              with each program execution.  This method may be appropriate on system  where  regular  maintenance  and  firmware
              updates  are  required.   This  method is not secure because device addresses can be determined using a variety of
              network management programs.  Anyone having access to this program, or the algorithm,  could  compute  the  device
              password  and gain access to device features reserved for privileged users.  This program does provide features to
              mitigate the risks of using this method.

OPTIONS
       -b bunch
              The password bunching factor.  Passwords consists of count uppercase letters and digits  optionally  displayed  in
              groups  separated by hyphens.  The bunching factor specifies the number of letters and digits in each group.  When
              bunch is 0 or greater than count, bunching is suppressed.  Separating hyphens increase  overall  password  length.
              The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 255.  The default is 0 which suppresses bunching.

       -e     Compute  passwords  based on host system entropy.  Passwords consist of uppercase letters [A-Z] optionally grouped
              using option -b.  This method produces a non-repeatable set of unique passwords over a given address range.   This
              method is the default and is secure.

       -l count
              The  number  of  letters  in  the password string.  Overall password length is the sum of count plus the number of
              delimiters implied by bunch.  The minimum is 12 and the maximum is 64.  The default is 16.

       -m     Compute passwords based on target device address.  Passwords consist of uppercase letters [A-Z].  This method pro‐
              duces a repeatable set of unique passwords over a given address range.  This method is not secure.

       -n number
              The  number  of  consecutive  addresses  and  passwords to compute and print.  The minimum is 0 and the maximum is
              1677215 or 0xFFFFFF.  The default is 1.  In addition, number cannot exceed the remaining  available  addresses  in
              the  vendor  range.  For example, given start address 00:B0:52:FF:FF:00, there are only 255 remaining addresses in
              the 00:B0:52 vendor range so it would be an error to request more than that number.

       -q     Quiet mode.  Exclude the device address on output.  This option can be used in  scripts  to  return  the  password
              associated with a given device address.

       -v     Verbose mode.  Prefix each line with a '0' column.  The Atheros Production Test System (PTS) uses the first column
              of a password database file to indicate which addresses and passwords have already been used.

       -?,--help
              Print program help information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       address
              The first Ethernet address expressed as 12 consecutive hexadecimal digits.  Puncutation  is  not  permitted.   The
              final  address of the range is computed by adding number to this address.  This argument is required.  There is no
              default address.  If more than one device address is specified then an address/password series  will  be  computed
              for each.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  prints  the  given  device address and a random password string on stdout.  The default password
       length is 25 characters long but the length can be changes using option -l.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001
          00B052000001 5KAXCQFQNN4PPNC76XN2YUWMS

       Repeating the command will generate a new password string.  This is the default behaviour and is the same  as  specifying
       option -e for &quot;entropy&quot;.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001
          00B052000001 CA35TM5JLG4S6XBKSM3HSU6J4

       This example ommits the device address.  Repeating the command produces a new password string.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -q
          2LJ6P5JPEHE6V63GZWC337Q8E
          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -q
          5Z8J7EGGL2HJDKMZ978W8V94W

       The  next  example shows how to generate passwords for three different devices with one command.  The program generates a
       password for each device address specified on the command line.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 00B05200BABE 00B05200DEAD
          00B052000001 NJHWXEFRPVVW87C9J4BQEHYYE
          00B05200BABE 5PT9Z64Z4TVRPEJCK8LR2XFMR
          00B05200DEAD 7R2LJYGJB42329AS4NM29H8V4

       The next example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and random passwords on stdout.  The starting device  address  is
       given and option -n specifies the number of addresses to print.  Output can be piped to a file or another process.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -n 10

       The  following  example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords but inserts a 0 at the start of each line to
       indicate that the address and password have not been used.  The Qualcomm Atheros Production Test System  (PTS)  will  set
       the 0 to 1 after it programs a device.  This format is simlar to PTS DBBuilder Utility output.

       The next example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords, as before, but changes password length and charac‐
       ter bunching.  Option -l specifies 12 characters and option -b specifies a bunching factor of three.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -n 10 -l 12 -b 3

       The next example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords, as before, but  starts  from  a  different  device
       address.   We  specified  option -m so that passwords are generated based on the MAC address.  This ensures that the same
       password is generated each time for a given device address.  We also specified password length  or  16  characters  using
       option -l and bunching factor of 4 with option -b.

       The following example prints 10 consecutive device addresses and passwords, as before, but starts from a different device
       address.  The address range here overlaps the range shown above but identical device addresses have identical  passwords.
       Address based passwords may be of interest on large private networks requireing frequent firmware upgrades or device con‐
       figuration.

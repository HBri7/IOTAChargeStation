nvmsplit(1)                                  Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                 nvmsplit(1)

NAME
       nvmsplit - Qualcomm Atheros PLC Firmware Image File Slicer

SYNOPSIS
       nvmsplit [options] file [file] [...]

DESCRIPTION
       Extract  all  images  from  an  Atheros binary image file, leaving the original files intact.  Extracted images appear in
       files having the input file basename with sequence numbers indicating the relative position of the image within the orig‐
       inal  file.   For  example,  image file abc.nvm might result in files abc-00.nvm, abc-01.nvm, abc-02.nvm and so on.  Each
       output file is a valid, single-image file and so they can be combined using program nvmmerge.

       Atheros image files consist of a chain of image headers, each followed by an image block.  Image blocks can contain data,
       applets  or  programs.  Atheros software reads the header chain and decides which images to download and execute based on
       information in the image headers.  Tampering with image headers or images may void some contractual obligations  made  by
       Atheros.

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the AMP man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -q     Suppress routine messages.  This option has no effect at this time.

       -v     Print component file names on stderr as they are created.

       -?,--help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!,--version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

ARGUMENTS
       file   The name of an Atheros image file.  By convention, Atheros Image files have a .nvm file extension but this program
              does not enforce this convention.  Invalid image files will be rejected causing the output to be incomplete.

EXAMPLES
       The  following  example  reads  Atheros  image file abc.nvm and creates one or more output files.  Each file contains one
       image with associated header.

          # nvmsplit abc.nvm -v
          nvmsplit: abc.nvm --&gt; abc-00.nvm
          nvmsplit: abc.nvm --&gt; abc-01.nvm
          nvmsplit: abc.nvm --&gt; abc-02.nvm
          nvmsplit: abc.nvm --&gt; abc-03.nvm

DISCLAIMER
       Atheros image file structure and content is proprietary to Qualcomm Atheros, Ocala FL USA.  Consequently, public informa‐
       tion  is  not  available.   Qualcomm  Atheros  reserves  the right to change file structure or content in future firmware
       releases without any obligation to notify or compensate users of this program.  This  program  is  reserved  for  use  by
       Atheros Field Engineers.  Use of this program may void some contractual obligations made by Atheros.

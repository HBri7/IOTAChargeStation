pev(1)                                       Qualcomm Atheros Open Powerline Toolkit                                      pev(1)

NAME
       pev - Qualcomm Atheros Plug-in Electric Vehicle Emulator

SYNOPSIS
       pev [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Emulate  the  PEV  part  of  the  HomePlug AV Signal Level Attentuation Characterization (SLAC) protocol where a PEV is a
       &quot;Plug-in Electric Vehicle&quot; and an EVSE is an &quot;Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment&quot; or charging station.  This program  will
       remain  active  until  it  detects  and  connects  to an available EVSE-HLE on the powerline network.  Once connected, it
       charges a virtual vehicle for about 10 seconds then disconnects and terminates.  See the HomePlug Green PHY Specification
       Release Version 1.1 for more information on this protocol.

       Signal  Level  Attenuation  Characterization  (SLAC) enables a station to measure the signal level of its transmission at
       other stations in the network.  It is designed for automotive applications  where  there  are  multiple  plug-in  vehicle
       (PEVs)  and  electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) on the network.  The PEV signal level is measured at multiple EVSEs
       to determine which EVSE the PEV is actually plugged into.  The process leading to this determination is called &quot;Green PHY
       PEV-EVSE Association&quot; (GreenPPEA).

       This  program  is  part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the plc man page for an overview and installation
       instructions.

OPTIONS
       -c     Print the PEV-HLE configuration profile on stdout.  The configuration profile specifies program defaults in a for‐
              mat that you, as a user, can edit and save.  Use options -p and -s to read named profiles and sections.

       -d     Print  the  contents of the PEV-HLE session variable on stdout.  The session variable is an program data structure
              that stores information passed between the PEV-HLE and EVSE-HLE during SLAC association.  This option is  used  to
              inspect  and  veriify  information  relevant to the process.  If the program was compiled with variable SLAC_DEBUG
              defined then this option also prints MME message fields before messages are  sent  or  after  they  are  received.
              Interested parties can follow along in the source code.

       -i     Select  the host Ethernet interface.  All requests are sent via this host interface and only reponses received via
              this host interface are recognized.  The default interface is eth1 because most people use eth0 as their principle
              network  connection;  however,  if  environment  string &quot;PLC&quot; is defined then it takes precedence over the default
              interface.  This option then takes precedence over either default.

       -p profile
              The PEV-HLE configuration profile name.  The program will supply default values for missing profile elements.  See
              the example profile shown below.  The default profile name is &quot;pev.ini&quot;.

       -q     Enter quiet mode.  Progress messages are suppressed.

       -s section
              The  configuration profile section name.  The program will supply default values for missing configuration profile
              elements.  See the example profile shown below.  The default section name is &quot;default&quot;.

       -v     Enter verbose mode.  All Etherenet frames sent or received by the program are displayed on stdout.

       -?, --help
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.

       -!, --version
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the command line.
              Use  this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that they know exactly which version of
              the Linux Toolkit you are using.

PROFILES
       The default configuration profile for this program is &quot;pev.ini&quot;.  The default profile section is  &quot;default&quot;.   Users  may
       create  addition profiles and reference them with option -p or add additional sections to an existing profiles and refer‐
       ence them with option -s.

       Attenuation Theshold
              The average attenuation above which the PEV will not connect to an EVSE.  The default value is 10db.

       MSound Pause
              The time in milliseconds between each MSound sent by the PEV-HLE to the EVSE-HLE.  Sending MSounds too  frequently
              overloads  the EVSE-PLC.  Sending them too infrequently wastes time.  This value is derived and does not appear in
              the HPGP specification.  The default pause is 10 milliseconds.

       Vehicle Identifier
              Vehicle identification.  The 17-byte Vehicle Identification Number to  be  placed  in  CM_MNBC_SOUND.IND.SenderID.
              This value is not used but is can be changed here so that the field is easy to spot within network message traces.

       Network Membership Key
              The  16-byte Network Memberhip Key (NMK) for the PEV-PLC device.  This program uses CM_SET_KEY to sets the PEV-PLC
              NMK to this value after disconnecting.  The default value is the key for Network Password &quot;HomePlugAV&quot;.

       Network Identifier
              The 7-byte Network Identifier (NID) for the PEV-PLC device.  This program uses CM_SET_KEY to sets the PEV-PLC  NID
              to this value after disconnecting.  The default value is the same as that for Network Password &quot;HomePlugAV&quot;.

REFERENCES
       See  the Qualcomm Atheros AR7420, QCA6410 IEEE 1901, HomePlug AV and QCA7000 HomePlug Green PHY PLC Chipset Programmer''s
       Guide or the HomePlug Green PHY Specification Release Version 1.1 for more information on this protocol.

EXAMPLES
       The following example starts a PEV session on interface eth0 and wait up to 2000 milliseconds (or 2 seconds) for the EVSE
       to respond during any given exchange.

          # pev -ieth0 -w2000

       The default PEV-HLE configuration profile, &quot;pev.ini&quot;, looks something like this but it can be changed using a normal text
       editor.  Use option -P to produce a template profile, if one is needed.

          # file: pev.ini
          # ====================================================================
          # PEV-HLE initialization;
          # --------------------------------------------------------------------
          [default]
          attenuation threshold = 10
          msound pause = 10
          vehicle identifier = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
          network membership key = 50D3E4933F855B7040784DF815AA8DB7
          network identifier = B0F2E695666B03
